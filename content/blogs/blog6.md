Hi! I'm Vani. 

I enjoy discovering the power of R & python for data analysis and visualization and this site is where I share what I learn and my latest work. Inspired by the helpful R community on Twitter and personal blogs I've discovered, I decided to share my learnings in hopes of helping others like those resources help me. I believe in the importance of communicating data-driven insights to all audiences and have grown a particular interest in data visualization and data storytelling. 

I have an academic background in statistics, professional experience in consulting at SAS, and am currently a Data and Reporting Analyst.
