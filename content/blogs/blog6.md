Hi, I'm Vani!

Currently I am an Analytics student at London Business School. I like using data and numbers to find interesting and surprising insights about things around the world. This website is an attempt at sharing the same with the world. I hope it helps you in one way or the other.

I have an academic background in Economics and love numbers. I aim to work as a Business Analyst in the Consumer Goods industry. 

Feel free to reach out to me for anything data!
